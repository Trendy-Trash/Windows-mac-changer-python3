Python scripts that changes the default wifi interface's mac address automatically


This is by no means a finished proyect. It is something I trew toguether in a couple afternoons during holidays to avoid a data usage limit on a public wifi.
This script will change the mac address on your computer, you need a connection before using it.
The script will list the connections available and pick the first one, this is normally your integrated wifi on a laptop.
You can set a task in windows to execute it every 30m or what you prefer. \n
The script will interrupt your internet connection, careful downloading big files.
